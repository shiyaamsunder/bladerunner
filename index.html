                    <h3>Blade Runner</h3>
                    <p>This 1982 film was directed by Ridley Scott and written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples. It
                        is loosely based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968). The film
                        is set in a dystopian future Los Angeles of 2019, in which synthetic humans known as replicants
                        are bio-engineered by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work at space colonies.</p>

                        expired in inventory, TYRELL CORP. pushed the series
                        8 into the local and Off-world market.
                        The NEXUS series 8 were purpose-built with a natural lifespan.

                        These angry masses used the Replicant Registration database to identify and kill Replicants.
